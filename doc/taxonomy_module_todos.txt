Taxonomy module - Todos

1) Tests to be written to cover (sub-)tree cloning and changing parent for subtree.
2) Tests should be rewritten not to use fixtures - partly done.
3) Creating acts is currently not initiated when creating subtrees - fixed, but needs testing.
4) parent_described_in may need more automation.
